## üéØ The Problem Statement

Many public or employer-sponsored programs provide **directed payments**, such as meal vouchers, that can only be used for specific purchases. While popular, these payment methods are rarely accepted online due to a significant technical challenge: merchants lack a simple, reusable solution to automatically identify which items in a shopping basket are eligible based on a complex, often country-specific, set of rules. This leads to costly custom integrations or merchants simply rejecting these payments, creating a frustrating experience for millions of users.

## ‚ú® Our Solution: Eligix

**Eligix** is a smart filtering platform that acts as a universal "brain" for any e-commerce checkout. We provide a single, robust API that merchants can integrate to seamlessly handle any directed payment program.

Our key innovation is using Google Cloud's AI suite- Vertex AI to analyze shopping baskets in real-time, **eliminating the need for merchants to provide a pre-defined product catalog**. Our dynamic rule engine, powered by Firestore, allows for on-the-fly adjustments for different countries and programs without a single line of code change, transforming a complex integration nightmare into a simple API call.
